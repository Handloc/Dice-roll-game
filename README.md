# Guess the Number

### General info

This is simple game for 2 players.
The goal is to roll a summary of 100 points.
After each roll player can decide to hold his points and give his rival a chance or to roll dice again.
But when player will roll out "1" then all his unhold points are gone and his turn is over.

###### I've made this project after lesson on Udemy, but I didn't copied and pasted code from there.

###### I've watched the video and with earned knowledge I've wrote this project by myself, adding features or changing concept a little bit if needed.
